# DeGate Testnet: Get Free Testnet Tokens on Goerli

The DeGate public testnet is now live. Since DeGate testnet runs on the Ethereum **Goerli test network**, you can get **free testnet tokens** to experience DeGate before our main launch.&#x20;

#### Step 1: Get Goerli ETH from the following faucet sites:&#x20;

#### Get 200 USDC AND 200 USDT instantly on your first fund addition on **Goerli**.

There are no requirements on your first fund addition, all token additions will be eligible for the free 200 USDC AND 200 USDT test tokens. The stablecoins will be sent to your wallet via DeGate internal transfer mechanism almost instantly after the completion of your first fund addition.&#x20;

#### You can also test other altcoins trades using ETH through [DeGate](https://testnet.degate.com) on Goerli.

Since DeGate supports permissionless listing, feel free to register any other ERC20 test tokens and create new trading pairs. Please note that you are unable to use the testnet token to make purchases "in real life" as they will only work in a testing environment.
