# DeGate Testnet: Basic Information

The DeGate public testnet is now live. Since DeGate testnet runs on the Ethereum **Goerli test network**, you can get **free testnet tokens** to experience DeGate before our main launch.&#x20;

## Basic Information&#x20;

Network: Goerli\
Testnet Link: [https://testnet.degate.com](https://testnet.degate.com)

## Important points to take note <a href="#blockchaindevopsengineer-qu-kuai-lian-yun-wei-kai-fa-gong-cheng-shi-whatyoullbedoing" id="blockchaindevopsengineer-qu-kuai-lian-yun-wei-kai-fa-gong-cheng-shi-whatyoullbedoing"></a>

### 1. Testnet tokens

Testnets allow you to interact with DeFi without investing real money. The Testnet is an alternative blockchain to be used for testing new tokens, allowing users to perform tasks in a hands-on manner without incurring financial risk.

To be clear, Testnet tokens = **Play money** (with no monetary value)

Testnet tokens are different from actual tokens, and they do not have any monetary value. As DeGate supports permissionless listing in testnet, users can freely register any other ERC20 testnet tokens and create new trading pairs. Please note that testnet tokens are meant to only work in a testing environment, therefore users are unable to make purchases "in real life".&#x20;

### 2. Maintenance&#x20;

In the testnet environment, feedback on improvements and bugs will be collated from  community users. As such, scheduled maintenance will still be performed on the protocol during the testnet phase. Timely announcements will be provided to the community during scheduled maintenance.&#x20;

### 3. Limitations of Testnet&#x20;

While Testnet is being deployed, it is also constrained by certain limitations. The limitations include throughput limits and lower TPS compared to the final Mainnet deployment. These planned limitations will enable the team to focus on ironing out the kinks as we gear up for Mainnet deployment.&#x20;
