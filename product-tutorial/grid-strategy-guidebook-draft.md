# Grid Strategy Guidebook \[Draft]

Grid Strategy or grid trading is a powerful trading tool that automates buying and selling within a defined range. A grid strategy automatically places _buy_ orders when prices drop and _sell_ orders when they rise, allowing you to capitalize on market fluctuations and generate profits. &#x20;

### How to set up Grid Strategy on DeGate?&#x20;

Let's use the guided example below.

First, head to [DeGate DEX](https://app.degate.com/) -> select "[Grid Strategy](https://app.degate.com/grid/USDC/ETH)" -> enter your desired trading pair such as ETH/USDC.
