# Permissionless Listing

To trade new assets in the DeGate protocol, users must register the token first and then add trading pairs for it, all in a permissionless manner. The registration information is recorded in the DeGate smart contract and cannot be modified.

### Listing Process

Anyone can call the `registerToken` method of the DeGate smart contract to register a new asset. The DeGate node regularly observes on-chain asset registration transactions. After a transaction is confirmed, the new asset will be automatically added to the token list that the node maintains. Alternatively, if a user calls the smart contractâ€™s deposit method, they can directly deposit unregistered assets, and the deposited tokens will be automatically registered.

Users can also list tokens on the degate.com website, via the following methods:

1. Searching for Assets in the Account Assets page;
2. Searching for Assets in the Trading Pair tab of the Trading /Grid Strategy page;
3. Entering the contract address of the new token on the Assets tab of the Deposit page.

### Listing Fees

DeGate does not charge any manual review fees that are common in centralized exchanges. Only Gas fees are required for a listing transaction.

### Token List

The DeGate node maintains a list of registered tokens for DeGate.

### Limitations

1. The DeGate protocol supports tokens up to: about 4.2 billion.
2. The DeGate node also supports the listing and trading of non-standard ERC20 assets, such as those with a transfer-to-burn mechanism and tokens whose supply automatically updates. However, evaluation is done one a case-by-case basis.
3. Newly registered assets are non-default tokens that can become default tokens if they meet the [requirements](../concepts/economic-security.md#default-token-list) during regular updates of the node operator.
