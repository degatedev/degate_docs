# Agency Bounty Program

If you are a Agency and would like to aid us in introducing suitable talent to the roles that we are looking for, we have made this simple!&#x20;

All you have to do is recommend candidates to us under the Agency Bounty Program and when your candidate is successful for the role, we will reward you with a Placement Fee.&#x20;

## How This Works

* Fill in the form with the appropriate information and click submit!

## What's on Offer

* Bounty for successful candidates introduced by your Agency.&#x20;
* The Bounty will be a percentage of the successful candidate's annual base, 22% for all Engineering roles and 20% for all other roles.

## What's the Catch?
