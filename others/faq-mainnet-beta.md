# FAQ - Mainnet Beta

## What is Mainnet Beta, how does it work?

Mainnet Beta is the final testing phase before the official Public Mainnet launch. During this phase, users are able to trade real assets using limit orders. Users can simply create a decentralized DeGate account and deposit funds.&#x20;

## How long will Mainnet Beta phase last for?

Mainnet Beta will run for approximately 8\~12 weeks. However, this duration may be adjusted based on the results of the ongoing $1.11 million Bug Bounty program with Immunefi. Learn more about the Bug Bounty program at [https://immunefi.com/bounty/degate/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/degate/)

## What happens after Mainnet Beta?

Once Mainnet Beta is complete, DeGate will move forward with the Public Mainnet launch, which will be deployed in the same environment as Mainnet Beta.

## What are the limitations of Mainnet Beta if any?

To ensure safety for all users, deposits will be capped during Mainnet Beta. In the unlikely event of any losses, DeGate DAO will cover them, capped at USD $5,000 per user.

## What are the security audits done for Mainnet Beta?

## Was there a previous Mainnet Beta deployment?

Yes, Mainnet Beta is the redeployment of Mainnet Beta(Legacy). This strategic upgrade aims to reinforce protocol security, ensuring DeGate protocol is always 100% trustless. All assets in the old environment have been automatically withdrawn as per protocol design and returned to users' registered Ethereum wallet addresses via the shutdown mode.
